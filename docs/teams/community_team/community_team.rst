What is contribution?
- All contributions are important for the success of the project, since contributions by newcomers might lead to happy and dedicated core contributors.
- This includes mentions like “It doesn’t work on my server” which too is a valuable contribution – the underlying message being e.g. “improve documentation”.
- Even failed contributions are essential, because of how much we can learn when we fail. Contribution from newcomers is especially valuable, because they see the project with fresh eyes.
